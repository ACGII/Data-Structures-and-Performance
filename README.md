# Data-Structures-and-Performance
## Coursera
These modules were developed using skeletal programs provided by the UCSD Mooc team.  They are part of the Data Structures and Performance course offered by Cousera.  The development I performed included:
1.  Working with Java's built-in classes for fundamental data structures including: String, LinkedList, TreeSet, HashSet, and HashMap. 
2.  Implementing fundamental data structures from scratch including Linked Lists and Tries.
3.  Analyzing the performance of code, using Big-O notation as well as through benchmarking experiments.
4.  Comparing and contrasting the performance of different data structures to select the most appropriate for a task.
5.  Write JUnit tests to ensure the correctness of the code.
6.  Implement several algorithms for generating and processing text.
